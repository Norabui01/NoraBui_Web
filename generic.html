									<h1>Hello! I am Nora<br />
									How are you today?</h1>
									<p>Welcome to my portfolio website! I'm happy to have you here and excited to share<br />
									my journey as a software engineer enthusiast with you. Let's take a look around and explore my projects.<br />
									And I hope you have a great day!</p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/profile1.jpg"alt="" /></div>
								<p>I would love to introduce myself as a dedicated and passionate student. I am pursuing double degrees in Computer Science 
									and Mathematical Sciences at McNeese State University. During my five semesters at McNeese, I have maintained a 3.95 GPA 
									with a full 4.0 in all of my Computer Science and Mathematical Sciences courses and made the Presidentâ€™s list every semester. 
									Experienced with front-end development in JavaScript, HTML5/CSS, ReactJS, NodeJS and back-end development in Java, Python, Django, 
									SQL, and PHP, I am interested in programming websites, building applications, and exploring AI. In the future, I aim to secure a 
									summer internship to enrich my skills in computer science and develop myself as a software engineer. I also plan to conduct research 
									into AI based on machine learning and mathematical knowledge during my senior year.</p>
								<p>Beyond my academic achievements, I am also actively involved in several extracurricular activities. I have served as the President of 
									the Mathematical Association of America (MAA) for the past year and a half. In that role, I am leading our MAA chapter with the mission 
									of fostering passion, talent, and promoting diversity in mathematics, science, and engineering. At the MAA conference at Ole Miss this 
									past March, I achieved second place in the Integration Bee, only the third student in the history of McNees to do this. Additionally, 
									under my leadership, MAA is planning to host a local math competition at McNeese early next year to prepare teams to compete at the 2024 
									MAA conference in New Orleans. We are working diligently to include at least 100 students from all majors to participate.In May 2023, 
									I was honored to be selected by the Math Department to join Pi Mu Epsilon. In addition, I am a member of the Association for Computing Machinery 
									and the Robotics Club. During E-week, I built a small delivery robot and was involved in showing high school kids how it works with games.</p>
